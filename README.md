## Description

- Motivation: Web development requires the knowledge of three programming languages that I had previously known very little about. Seeing this as a challenge, I felt motivated to be novicely versed in these three languages in order to be effect in the following bootcamp class. Learning these basic skills and abilities have ultimatley opened a whole world of new posibilites.
- Reason: The develoopment of this webpage allowed me to familarize myself with the web development process and resoursces available to a modern day developer.
- Problem Solved: I learned how to use the software tools required for my bootcamp while simultaneously getting on the same page with classmates that will inevetably become project partners.
- Learned Content: I learned the basics of the three web developing languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how to integrate each one effectively into a webpage study guide for future user refrence.
