        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage that the browser uses to serve to webpage to the user.</li>
          <li>This information is known as metadata and is only visible to the developer; other than the title.</li>
          <li>The viewport gives the browser instructions on how to control the pages dimensions and scaling.</li>
          <li>Elements nested within another element are reffered to as child elements, while the element that is containing, is called the parent element.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>It is good practice to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when content will be visible to users.</li>
          <li>The words element and tag are sometimes used interchangebly but there is a difference.</li>
          <li>Elements refer to the content from opening tab to closing tab.</li>
          <li>Tags refers only to what is within the angled brackets.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is programming language that defines how webpage content is presented to the users. It provides styling visual layout options.</li>
          <li>An inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style and elemend directly in the HTML file. These are useful for quick changes but are permanent and sometimes less favorable than other methods.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets are entirely embeded in an HTML file using a style element nested in the head parent element. This contains CSS rules for the webpage. These rules only applly to that page and classes and id's can be used to style multiple elements simultaneously.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets allows developers to keep all their rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. This is untimately the preferred method of the three style sheets.</li>
          <li>SoC or separation of concerns is the principle of separting code into different files based on use. In other words, each section of code should have their own responsibility.</li>
          <li>A program that utilizes Soc is considered modular. Modules can espose different versions of interface, which increases freedom to upgrade and update a complex system in peice-meal fashion, without interm loss of function.</li>
          <li>The Selector defines the element or attribute to which the rules or declaration will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components; the CSS propertey we want to applly and the value of the property. (ex: color:blue)</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Colors have corresponding hexadecimal codes or hex #'s that can be refrenced.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that alows you to manage and keep track of each version of your project, locally on your own coputer.</li>
          <li>Git status: checks as to which branch we are currently operation on</li>
          <li>Git checkou branch-name: will allow you to navigate to said branch.</li>
          <li>Git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and then switches to said new branch.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in their own unique commit</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>Developers use repositories, aslo known as repos, as folders to store; files that contain code, files that contain information about code, or the version history for all the files in the repository.</li>
          <li>GitHub Issues is a built in to do list to keep you and your team on track.</li>
